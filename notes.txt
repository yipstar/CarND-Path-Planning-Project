Oh, I just added 6 time the d_value as they suggested. Such as: map_waypoints_x[i]+ 6*map_waypoints_dx[i]

I'm just starting out, and i'm trying to get the car drive on a straight line with just incrementing s and keeping d constant (middle lane). And then converting these back to x, y and using spline to generate a trajectory. Because of the way the getXY function is written, (simple linear interpolation), it's causing the car to jerk everytime it reaches a waypoint. How are you guys writing the keep lane trajectory generation?

use splines to fit your waypoints
