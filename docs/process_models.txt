Lane Following process models
1. Linear point model, too simplistic
2. Non-Linear point model (constant acceleration with curvature)
3. Kinematic bicycle model with controller (PID controller on distance and angle)

Use 3

W is uncertainty. Use a multivariat guassian with 0 mean.

4 Dynamic bicycle model with controller (PID on distance and angle)
not worth computation overhead, uncertainty is bigger influence than accuracy.

Use AMM
Autonomous Multiple Model Algorithm

normalizer would be 2 since we are only considering 2 manueuvers

// Behaviors Stay Same, Speed Up, Slow Down, Change Lane.
    // model these behaviors in the following way
    // Stay Same: Follow lane A with constant velocity
    // Speed Up: Follow lane A with positive acceleration
    // Slow Down: Follow lane A with negative acceleration
    // Change Lane: Follow lane B with constant velocity
